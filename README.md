SCodex - https://scodex.garga.net

You can create issues from the [***Issues***](https://github.com/mmomtchev/scodex/issues) tab

SCodex has been made possible thanks to:
* me - in-game Garga Roshava - who did all the coding
* ventorvar from the [SC Modding Community](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/frameworks/scdatatools) - who created the tools used to extract data from the game files
* Ben from [Meridian | Exploration Group](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/MEREX) - who did most of the work on recreating the PlanetTech
* Graupunkt from [Meridian | Exploration Group](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/MEREX) - for his invaluable work on the navigation and the game mechanics
* Murphy from [Murphy Exploration Group](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/MURPH) - who came up with the equations describing the rotation of the planets
